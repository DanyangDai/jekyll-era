I co-founded Equity Research Association (ERA) with the aim of showcasing the objective research done by our analysts, developing and honing our skillsets in a supportive environment as well as a platform for students of similar passion.

Previously, I held an analyst position in ZeroCap, a digital asset firm for private clients. I performed equity research analysis on investing opportunities for private clients, high net worth individuals and institutions globally. I also assisted in the R&D of multiple start-up ventures.

Apart from academics, I'm passionate about value and growth investing, cooking and fitness. Currently, I have been looking into Chart and Pattern analysis, Derivatives and Blockchain in Python.
