You're interested in purchasing your friend's booming hot-dog stand But how do you determine the value?

- find the equity value of the business
- add the debt that your friend's business owes
- the cash in the register is yours, so exclude it

The number you figure out from the above calculation would then be the theoretical purchase price of the company

That's what the WALL STREET folks call an Enterprise Value

The Market Value of Apple, Inc (AAPL) is $ 1.3 Trillion but if you ever were to purchase the whole company, you would need $ 1.9 Trillion
